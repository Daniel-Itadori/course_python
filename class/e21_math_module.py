# Import the math module (as you want)


# Make the Poisson distribution. The user must enter the parameters. Then print out the result


# Make an iterable with some numbers to calculate the product of all those numbers


# From two iterables, calculate the sum of the product of values


# Calculate the GCD of two numbers that user gives



# Make the binomial distribution. The user must enter the values: n, x, p. Then print out the result



# The user enter a float number, and then the ceiling of that number must appear in the screen, as
# "the ceiling of x is y "


# Choose two functions from the math documentation to make exercises like the previous
